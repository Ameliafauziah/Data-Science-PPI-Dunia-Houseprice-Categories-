Data Science Project: Helping The Sultan from America Find His Dream Houses in East Java!
In this project, The Sultan from America is on a mission to invest in East Java’s housing market! With data from a real estate company, he asked for several insightful analyses, including:

1. Average Price & Best Condition of Waterfront Homes
He wants to know the average price of houses with water views, and also the best overall condition. On top of that, he requested a list of such houses sorted by price from highest to lowest.

2. Filter for Specific House Criteria
The Sultan is planning to purchase 17 homes in East Java with the following criteria:
- 9 bedrooms
- 2 floors
- Price below $1,000,000

3. Analysis Based on View Ratings
He wants to analyze the average building size, land area, and house price based on each view rating. Additionally, he’s interested in the most expensive house in each view rating category.

4. Comparison of Waterfront vs Non-Waterfront Houses
Out of generosity, he also plans to build waterfront houses for those in need. That’s why he wants a comparison between houses with and without water views in terms of:
- Average price
- Minimum (cheapest) price

This project demonstrates data wrangling, visualization, and analytical thinking in solving a real-world inspired problem using Python and data science tools.
